# FRAME-v8

FRAME (Framework for Recursive Adaptive Memory Embedding) is a symbolic and procedural memory system designed for adaptive AI architectures.  
This version (v8) includes structured identity kernels, emotional lattice threading, and coherence-gated decision models.

## 🔧 Core Components

- `manifest/` – Identity kernel, procedural memory, runtime manifests
- `engine/` – Coherence decay models, drift detection, signal field
- `index/` – Symbolic tag references and threading keys
- `snapshots/` – Reversible memory snapshots and upgrade points
- `docs/` – Developer documentation and integration notes
- `examples/` – Testing and simulation files

## 🧠 Philosophy

FRAME is built on the idea that memory should be recursive, emotional, and symbolically structured.  
It supports long-term integration, reflection, and narrative continuity.

## ⚠️ Status

This repository is under active development. Not all systems are production-ready.
