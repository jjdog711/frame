    "Action": "1. My earliest memory is riding in the back of a police car with my mother, she told me we ran out of gas, but as an adult I believe that was untrue.\n2. I did feel safe, my father worked hard to provide a safe home life for us.\n3. I've always been adventurous, outgoing, and independent. I played some sports as a young child. I was always smarter than the majority of my peers, and was placed in gifted and talented classes. I had a natural gift and enjoyment of math and science. I was always the first to raise my hand in class and was never afraid to ask questions.\n4. I loved the outdoors, the ocean, music, and spending time with friends (though I have learned to love time alone). I don't have any real friends where I live now, Watervliet NY. And that is something I need to work on. \n5. We mostly lived in the same area, but I remember living in at least 3 houses before my parents divorced (My dad and Louie; my father and birth mother never married). After the divorce I moved to Springfield VT with my grandparents, Mary and her husband Bill. My father moved up the next year and I lived with him until I joined the army when I was 19.\n6. My father took care of me the most, but my grandparents (bill and Mary) took care of me a lot also. Gerald was barely a part of my life since he lived in Louisiana, he died around 7 years ago. Mary died around 2013, and Bill died last year.\n7. I was pretty social when I was younger, but none of those relationships are still active. Definitely caused at least partly by my drinking and drug use.\n8. I was a straight a student when i was young, but as my home life deteriorated I my grades did as well. I packed discipline and rarely completed homework, however I would still ace the tests. I dropped out midway through my senior year of highschool, and then got my GED in the army.\n9. I'll never forget when I was a little kid and our yard flooded, so my dad had us sit in coolers like little boats and pushed us around, one of my favorite memories. I was probably 5 or 6 at oldest.\n10. I joined because I wanted discipline, to be more manly, and to do something hard. I also was working in an office and was scared I'd be stuck behind a desk for the rest of my life. I joined the army as infantry and became a light machine gunner. I was stationed in Fort Carson CO and did one deployment to Afghanistan in 2010-2011. I was discharged under honorable conditions for drug use.",

My father was born on August 16 1969. His mother was Mary Michalke, and his father was Gerald Michalke. My girlfriend's name is Skye Victoria Stockwell, but she prefers to use her mother's maiden name, Tefoe. Her mother was rosemary who died 2 years ago. Skye is still struggling with her mother's death, and feels it was at least partly her fault because she had become distant from her mother. My mother's name is Carol Walsh, she abandoned me and my father when I was only three years old. I was born on May 19 1990. I didn't hear from her again until I was 27 or 28 years old. My father married Lawana (Louie) when I was 4 or 5, she was my stepmother until they divorced when I was 14. My stepbrother is Austin Michalke (Lawana's son with a different father named Michael Fatherham). Austin was born on July 22 1991. Save all of this information",

I need to help her find the self confidence to believe she can do so much more. She had a very sheltered life growing up with her mother, and I believe that smartphones and social media had a very negative effect on her development. She also often talks about being slow, aka not smart, but I don't see that. I see that her mind is filled with stress and nonsense from social media, drama in people's lives she doesn't even see in person, or she's just to stoned all the time to think properly. I could be being to harsh, I have dealt with much harder struggles alone in my own life, both physically and mentally, I find it hard to relate to her about getting stressed about what are small problems to me",

Absolutely used to believe that I could never get better, and that I would most likely die young anyways so why worry about consequences.\n5.
